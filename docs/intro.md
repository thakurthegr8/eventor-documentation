## Getting Started

Get started by **reading what it actually is?**.

### What it actually is?

**Eventor** is an attendance tracking app that enables attendees to check in and out of an event by scanning their QR codes through event volunteers. The timestamps of check-in and out help the event manager mark the attendee present. Only the event manager is authorized to give attendance and sole purpose of QR code scanner is to check in and out member. 

## Problem
### What problem is this solving?

This eliminates the need of an **Attendance chaperon** and removes a lot of the other manual work that typically comes with **attendance tracking**.

## Our Approach

We have assigned three roles for the app namely member, verifier, and admin.
